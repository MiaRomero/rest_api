Follow the directions found here https://github.com/seattle-javascript-401d7/rest_api (Links to an external site.)

Create a rest API with Express that's backed by Mongo with two resources (for example, /users and /penguins).

Be sure to implement full REST operations for each resource (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)

I'm leaving this pretty open to interpretation. I want you to write this from scratch, don't just copy and paste code from class or previous projects.

Finally, implement a non CRUD endpoint (meaning that is does not simply Create, Read, Update, or Destroy information in your database). When a user hits a url endpoint, the server will do something with the data that is not a CRUD operation and return the data. For example,  /users/averageAge might return the average age of all users.

In your assignment submission add a comment that includes how long it took to complete and a reflection on the process.
